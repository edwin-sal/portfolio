				<h2>Studeefy</h2>
				<p>Studeefy is a Learning Management System (lms) that I built for our capstone project at university. Unlike any other lms, Studeefy has an ai-powered automated features such as automated flashcards and quiz creation.</p>

				<p>The automated feature works by the user uploading a document preferebly containing educational content. The text content of the document are then extracted and passed to OpenAI's GPT API and with the correct instructions given, it will pass back a formatted content that can be used to create flashcards and quizzes!!</p>

				<p>Aside from automation, studeefy also pack very similar features to MS teams as it was the main insipiration of it. Virtual classes, quizzes, assignments, messaging, and file uploads! all of these happening in Studeefy.</p>

				<p>this is definitely the best one i have built yet.</p>

				<h2>Pokemon Guessing Game</h2>

				<p>up to this date i still have not thought about giving it a proper name so i guess it will still be called the pokemon guessing game. this one is definitely the most fun i have built. its an android app but built using web technologies such as react and ionic.</p>

				<p>How does it work? well if you have read the title then you already know. btw, this one uses PokeAPI which is great for getting information about Pokemons. additionally, it can store date such as scores and users using local storage.</p>
